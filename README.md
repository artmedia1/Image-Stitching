# Image-Stitching
The goal of this project is to write a mosaic/panorama application. A panorama is a wide-angle image constructed
by compositing together a number of images with overlapping fields-of-view in a photographically plausible way. The notebook will go over the following steps:

1. Preprocessing
2. Detect keypoints and extract descriptors
3. Match features
4. Prune features
5. Robust transformation estimation (RANSAC Implementation)
6. Compute optimal transformation
7. Create panorama
